/** Production build of the public landing page for GitHub Pages.
 * WHAT: a static, server-free site served from https://thatg33k-t33.github.io/Seene/.
 * WHY: GitHub Pages hosts project sites under a repository path, so every emitted
 *      asset URL must carry that base prefix.
 * WHERE: .github/workflows/pages.yml publishes the output of `npm run build:pages`.
 *
 * Deliberately excludes seenePlatformPlugin: that plugin only mounts middleware for
 * `vite dev`/`vite preview` and would pull Node-only modules into a static bundle.
 * The local studio keeps using vite.config.ts, and the npm package build is untouched.
